## [English] This is a swedish mod of the game Wordle. See more below
### Ordlek - en svenk version av Worlde
Gissa dagens ord! Varje dag kommer ett nytt fembokstavsord. Du har sex f√∂rs√∂k p√• dig att lista ut det. √Ñr du snabbare √§n dina kompisar?
### Credits/Copyright
This is just a mod. So all credits goes to the inventor of Worlde:  Josh Wardle [https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/].

I would also like to thank the Swedish Scabble Community [http://scrabbleforbundet.se/] for keeping such an exelent Swedish world list available.

Last but now least: Den stora svenska Ordlistan and the swedish dictionary used my myspell/hunspell on Linux was also consulted.
